# Google-PageRank-Algo
This project gives a Visualisation of PageRank algorithm. It consists of three parts spidering, computation and visualisation.
<h2>PageRank algorithm:</h2>
<p1>
  <h3>Definition</h3><br>
  PageRank (PR) is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank websites in their search engine results. PageRank was named after Larry Page, one of the founders of Google. PageRank is a way of measuring the importance of website pages. <br>
  <h3>Algorithm</h3><br>
The PageRank algorithm outputs a probability distribution used to represent the likelihood that a person randomly clicking on links will arrive at any particular page. PageRank can be calculated for collections of documents of any size. It is assumed in several research papers that the distribution is evenly divided among all documents in the collection at the beginning of the computational process. The PageRank computations require several passes, called “iterations”, through the collection to adjust approximate PageRank values to more closely reflect the theoretical true value.<br>
